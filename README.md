# Scrape Women Candidates from CAWP & Make Shiny App

This project was created with data scraped from the website of the [Center for American Women in Politics](http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu). The Center conducts research on women's participation in politics in America and maintains [a list](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/buzz-2018-potential-women-candidates-us-congress-and-statewide-elected-executive) of women who are or potentially will be running for US Congress and State offices.

The code scrapes and combines data from their lists of women candidates, creates new variables, and visualizes the data in an interactive `shiny` map and searchable data table using `plotly` and `DT` packages .

See the app in action [here](https://jennylistman.shinyapps.io/WomenCandidates/) and read a blog post about it [here](https://medium.com/@jblistman/an-app-to-search-for-women-running-for-office-in-2018-346f5a013ec9).  
Data included in the app are up to date as of 2/16/2017.
